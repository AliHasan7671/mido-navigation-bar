You can use this module for enabling navigation bar and disabling capacitive buttons on mido. It will also disable backlight of capacitive buttons.

The module is for mido and if you face any issue, contact me on Telegram here [@AliHasan7671](https://t.me/AliHasan7671).

## Note:

Currently, it works on AOSP ROMs only. MiUI support will be added later.
